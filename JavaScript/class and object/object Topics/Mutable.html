    <h1>Objects are Mutable</h1>
    <p>Objects are mutable:they are addressed by reference, not by value.</p>
     <p>Any changes to a copy of an object will also change the original object:</p>
     <p>If person is an object, the following statement will not create a copy of person:</p>
     <p id="demo"></p>
     <script>
        const person={
            firstName:"John",
            lastName:"Doe",
            age:50,
            eyeColor:"blue"
        };
        const x=person;
        x.age=10;
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML=person.firstName+" is "+person.age+" Year old. ";
